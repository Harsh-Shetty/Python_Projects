1) pip install Pillow                                  -----> models.ImageField in Project/users/models.py require this python package

2) python manage.py makemigrations      -----> Saves and checks the health of migrations & initialises the model (here Profile)

3) python manage.py migrate                   -----> Creates changes to the database. This loads the model in the Database.

4) Goto Project/users/admin.py and add ([from .models import Profile] [admin.site.register(Profile)])
    This is to register the model. This adds Profile to the admin page of the Web app.

5) python manage.py runserver               -----> Check if Profile was sucessfully. Open browser localhost:8000/admin.
				    Username: Arthur; Pass: testing321 (if login required). Can cr8 profile with 'Add Profile' btn. Cr8 
                                                                         profile 4 Arthur & upload a image . Cr8 profile for TestUser & don't give a profile pic


6) python manage.py shell                                               -----> Opens Pyhton interactive cmd line for manage.py
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User          -----> User model imported. Refer Project/users/models.py
>>>user = User.objects.filter(username='Arthur').first()  -----> Grab user. filter gives all fileds with the given val. 'first()' give the first result
>>>user                                                                          -----> To check if user is correct
<User: Arthur>
>>>user.profile
<Profile: Arthur Profile>                                                                                           -----> We get profile obj in O/P
>>>user.profile.image
<ImageFieldFile: profile_pics/AC_4.jpg>                                                                  -----> We get models.ImageField obj
(NOTE: we can try cmd like user.profile.image.width or user.profile.image.height)
>>>user.profile.image.url                                                                                          -----> for image location
'/profile_pics/AC_4.jpg'
(NOTE: Images with same name don't override each other. Django gives hash val to each image. Now let's check the TestUser)
>>> user = User.objects.filter(username='TestUser').first()
>>> user
<User: TestUser>
>>> user.profile.image
<ImageFieldFile: default.jpg>                                                                                   -----> We get default profile pic as expected. It was coded in                                                                                                                                                   Project/users/models.py
>>>exit()                                                                                                                  -----> To exit the python shell

NOTE: There is no default pic added yet. Just the name exists. Project/users/models.py aslo creates a profile_pics dir in Django_Web_App\Project.
profile_pics/AC_4.jpg can be found there.
We don't want profile_pics dir to clutter up the root dir
To clean up/organise the dir we add MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media') & MEDIA_URL = '/media/' to the last part of 
Django_Web_App\Project\Project\settings.py file. Check the comments there for code explanation. Also, import os in settings.py

7) Delete the Profiles created, through the browser after this as the dir changes made won't be applied to previously created profiles.

8) Cr8 profiles again as previously done

9) New dir created in Django_Web_App\Project\media\profile_pics. Delete old profile_pics dir.

To delete old pics once new pics were uploaded:

1. pip install django-cleanup
2.  in settings.py
 INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'django_cleanup', # should go after your apps

)
