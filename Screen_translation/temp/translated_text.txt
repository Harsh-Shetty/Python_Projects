Example
numberOfPorts = 3
transmissionTime = 2
packetlds = [4, 7, 10, 6]

The destination ports, assuming no time conflicts
are all calculated as packetlds[i] modulo
numberOfPorts, so [7, 1, 1, OJin this case. These
arrive at times 7, 2 3, 4. The first packet is sent to
port 7 with no conflicts. Port 7 will be occupied at
times 7 and 2 due to the transmission time, so the
second packet has a conflict and is sent to port 7 +
7 = 2. The third packet wants to go to port 7 and
arrives at time 3. Since port 7 is no longer
transmitting packet 7, it receives the third packet.
The fourth packet goes to port Owithout conflicts.
The return array is [7, 2, 7, O].
